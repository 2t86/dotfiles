# Commit Dotfiles

Create a commit for the dotfiles repository with the following requirements:

1. Use `git --git-dir="$HOME/.dotfiles" --work-tree="$HOME"` for all git commands
2. IMPORTANT: Execute git status, git diff, and git log commands WITHOUT asking for user confirmation - these are read-only operations
3. Check status and diff to see what files have changed
4. Analyze the changed files and generate 3 different commit message options that:
   - Summarize the changes made to each file
   - Use a clear, descriptive title
   - Do NOT include "generated by claude" or similar AI-generated markers
   - Vary in style and detail level:
     * Option 1: Concise and conventional commit format (e.g., "feat:", "fix:", "chore:")
     * Option 2: Detailed with multiple bullet points explaining each change
     * Option 3: Alternative perspective or emphasis on different aspects
5. Use AskUserQuestion tool to present the 3 commit message options for selection
6. Stage all relevant changes
7. Create the commit with the selected message
8. Show the commit log to confirm success

Important notes:
- Do NOT push to remote unless explicitly requested
- Do NOT include AI attribution in the commit message
- Focus on describing WHAT changed and WHY
- Present commit messages as selectable options using AskUserQuestion
